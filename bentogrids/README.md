# Task: Front-Component UI Section

## Overview
This task involves designing and implementing a UI section similar to the one shown in the reference image. The goal is to ensure consistency in design, including colors, typography, spacing, and responsiveness.

## Task Requirements
Participants need to build a UI section that meets the following specifications:

### 1. Layout & Structure:
- The section should be divided into multiple grid-based cards.
- Each card should contain relevant text and images.
- Ensure proper alignment and spacing between elements.
- Use a **modern and minimalistic design approach**.

### 2. Design Specifications:
- **Background Colors:**
  - Dark Gray (#1A1A1A) for the main offer card
  - Light Gray (#F5F5F5) for the background
  - White (#FFFFFF) for secondary elements
  - Pastel Purple (#B89EFF) for "About us"
  - Neon Green (#C8FF00) for "Contact us"
  - Soft Gray (#EDEDED) for "View our blog"

- **Typography:**
  - Font Family: `Inter`, `Poppins`, or `Sans-serif`
  - Font Sizes:
    - Main Heading: `40px`, bold
    - Sub Headings: `24px`, medium
    - Body Text: `18px`, regular
  - Font Weight:
    - Headings: `Bold`
    - Sub-text: `Medium`

### 3. Components & Elements:
- Buttons should have rounded corners (`border-radius: 12px`).
- Icons should match the reference style (minimalistic and modern).
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout structuring.
- Apply hover effects and smooth transitions for interactive elements.
- Ensure proper padding and margin for visual balance.
- Include a **subtle shadow** effect on cards for depth.
